Saorsa aims to be an opinionated, [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)-driven theme. It will be responsive, and make extensive use of newer CSS features. Backwards compatibility with browsers is not guaranteed.

Customisation through a Child Theme is recommended. Nearly everything can be overridden.

Gutenberg support is unlikely.
